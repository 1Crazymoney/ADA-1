My solution for problems.

IDE:
GPS (Gnat Programming Studio) usage: 
Menu Project - new .. - single project forward - 
name and choose a directory where you work 

You need to have at least one main file.
Menu Project - Properties - Main Files - Add at + 
add a file which you want ot run

Menu Build - compile - build - run (or the icons under menu)

In cmd window compiling is gnatmake hello.adb
Run the executable file hello
